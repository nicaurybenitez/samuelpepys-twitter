1665-03-16 22:06 Come Mr. Andrews with 36l, the further fruits of my Tangier contract, and so to bed late and weary with business, but in good content of mind, blessing God for these his benefits.

1665-03-16 15:40 Mr. Harris, the sayle-maker, sent me a noble present of two large silver candlesticks and snuffers, and a slice to keep them upon, which indeed is very handsome.

1665-03-15 16:27 To Gresham College, where, among other good discourse, there was tried the great poyson of Maccassa upon a dogg,1 but it had no effect all the time we sat there.

1665-03-14 13:05 Dined with Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes, at the Tower, with Sir J. Robinson, at a farewell dinner which he gives Major Holmes at his going out of the Tower, where he hath for some time, since his coming from Guinny, been a prisoner.

1665-03-13 21:44 This day my wife begun to wear light-coloured locks, quite white almost, which, though it makes her look very pretty, yet not being natural, vexes me, that I will not have her wear them.

1665-03-13 15:10 Meeting a letter from Mrs. Martin desiring to speak with me, I (though against my promise of visiting her) did go, and there found her in her childbed dress desiring my favour to get her husband a place.

1665-03-13 05:32 Up betimes, this being the first morning of my promise upon a forfeite not to lie in bed a quarter of an hour after my first waking.

1665-03-12 15:40 I after much discourse with my Lady about Sir G. Carteret’s son, of whom she hath some thoughts for a husband for my Lady Jemimah, we away home.

1665-03-12 12:20 My Lord and I talked of getting W. Howe to be put into the Muster-Mastershipp in the roome of Creed, if Creed will give way, but my Lord do it without any great gusto, calling Howe a proud coxcomb in passion.

1665-03-12 11:32 I read over the Bishop of Chichester’s sermon upon the anniversary of the King’s death, much cried up, but, methinks, but a mean sermon.

1665-03-11 19:22 This day returned Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes from Lee Roade, where they have been to see the wrecke of “The London,” out of which, they say, the guns may be got, but the hull of her will be wholly lost, as not being capable of being weighed.

1665-03-10 15:05 To the Committee of Tangier at White Hall, where my Lord Barkely and Craven and others; but, Lord! to see how superficially things are done in the business of the Lottery, which will be the disgrace of the Fishery, and without profit.

1665-03-10 12:43 To the ‘Change, where very hot, people’s proposal of the City giving the King another ship for “The London,” that is lately blown up, which would be very handsome, and if well managed, might be done.

1665-03-09 21:58 This night my wife had a new suit of flowered ash-coloured silk, very noble.

1665-03-09 16:28 At Paule’s Schoole, where I visited Mr. Crumlum at his house; and, Lord! to see how ridiculous a conceited pedagogue he is, though a learned man, he being so dogmaticall in all he do and says.

1665-03-09 15:12 It is strange to see how a liberty and going abroad without purpose of doing anything do lead a man to what is bad, for I was just upon going to Mrs. Martin, where I must of necessity have broken my oath or made a forfeit.

1665-03-09 15:06 I to Westminster, where I hear Mrs. Martin is brought to bed of a boy and christened Charles, which I am very glad of, for I was fearful of being called to be a godfather to it.

1665-03-08 10:17 About 24 and a woman that were in the round-house and coach saved; the rest, being above 300, drowned: the ship breaking all in pieces, with 80 pieces of brass ordnance.

1665-03-08 10:15 Is brought me to the office the sad newes of “The London,” in which Sir J. Lawson’s men were all bringing her from Chatham to the Hope, and thence he was to go to sea in her; but a little a’this side the buoy of the Nower, she suddenly blew up.

1665-03-08 06:06 I rose, and though my pain and tenderness in my testicle remains a little, yet I do verily think that my pain yesterday was nothing else, and therefore I hope my disease of the stone may not return to me.

1665-03-07 14:24 I went to make water, not dreaming of any thing but my testicle that by some accident I might have bruised as I used to do, but in pissing there come from me two stones, I could feel them, but without any pain to me in going out.

1665-03-07 11:52 Going to the office, and I think it was sitting with my back to the fire, it set me in a great rage again, that I could not continue till past noon at the office, but was forced to go home.

1665-03-07 05:50 I was troubled all this night with a pain in my left testicle, that run up presently into my left kidney and there kept akeing all night. In great pain.

1665-03-06 16:15 Home, and there find our new chamber-maid, Mary, come, which instead of handsome, as my wife spoke and still seems to reckon, is a very ordinary wench, I think, and therein was mightily disappointed.

1665-03-06 12:26 Home to dinner, where I saw Besse go away; she having of all wenches that ever lived with us received the greatest love and kindness and good clothes, besides wages, and gone away with the greatest ingratitude.

1665-03-06 09:10 Great preparations for the Duke’s speedy return to sea. I saw him try on his buff coat and hatpiece covered with black velvet. It troubles me more to think of his venture, than of anything else in the whole warr.

1665-03-05 13:32 At dinner my Lord did use me with the greatest solemnity in the world, in carving for me, and nobody else, and calling often to my Lady to cut for me; and all the respect possible.

1665-03-05 12:45 To my Lord Sandwich’s and dined with my Lord; it being the first time he hath dined at home since his coming from sea: and a pretty odd demand it was of my Lord to my Lady before me: “How do you, sweetheart? How have you done all this week?”

1665-03-04 20:22 This day was proclaimed at the ’Change the war with Holland.

1665-03-04 16:37 William Howe come to see me, being come up with my Lord from sea: he is grown a discreet, but very conceited fellow.

1665-03-04 12:13 To the office, where we sat all the morning, I, with being empty and full of ayre and wind, had some pain to-day.

1665-03-04 07:05 Up very betimes, and walked, it being bitter cold, to Ratcliffe, to the plate-maker’s and back again.

1665-03-03 10:20 To see Mrs. Turner, who takes it mighty ill I did not come to dine with the Reader, her husband, which, she says, was the greatest feast that ever was yet kept by a Reader. But I am glad I did not go, which confirms her in an opinion that I am growne proud.

1665-03-03 00:08 Very busy till 12 at night, and vexed at my wife’s staying out so late, she not being at home at 9 o’clock, but at last she is come home, but the reason of her stay I know not yet.

1665-03-02 13:47 Dined with Sir W. Batten (my wife being gone again to-day to buy things, having bought nothing yesterday for lack of Mrs. Pierce’s company).

1665-03-02 05:55 Begun this day to rise betimes before six o’clock, and, going down to call my people, found Besse and the girle with their clothes on, lying within their bedding upon the ground close by the fireside, and a candle burning all night, pretending they would rise to scoure.

1665-03-01 17:55 Here was fine discourses and experiments, but I do lacke philosophy enough to understand them, and so cannot remember them. Among others, a very particular account of the making of the several sorts of bread in France, which is accounted the best place for bread in the world.

1665-03-01 17:06 To the meeting, where Sir G. Carteret’s two sons, his owne, and Sir N. Slaning, were admitted of the society: and this day I did pay my admission money – 40s. – to the society.

1665-03-01 15:29 To Gresham College, where Mr. Hooke read a second very curious lecture about the late Comett; among other things proving very probably that this is the very same Comett that appeared before in the year 1618.

1665-03-01 08:12 My wife did, notwithstanding last night’s falling out, come to peace with me and I with her, but I did boggle mightily at the parting with my money, but at last did give it her, and then she abroad to buy her things.

1665-03-01 08:10 This day being the day that, by a promise, a great while ago, made to my wife, I was to give her 20l. to lay out in clothes against Easter.
