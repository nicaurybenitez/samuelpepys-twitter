1664-03-15 23:10 We up to bed, my wife and I in the little blue chamber, and I lay close to my wife, being full of disorder and grief for my brother.

1664-03-15 22:02 And so this was the end of my poor brother, talking idle and his lips working even to his last that his phlegm hindered his breathing.

1664-03-15 21:41 Mrs. Croxton, Holden, and the rest did strip and lay my brother out, they observing his corpse to be as clear as any they ever saw.

1664-03-15 20:52 It was a most sad sight to see the poor wretch lie now still and dead, and pale like a stone.

1664-03-15 20:35 I found the nurse holding my brother’s eyes shut, he a most sad sight, and that which put me into a present very great transport of grief.

1664-03-15 20:23 I led Mrs. Turner home, but before I came back, which was in half a quarter of an hour, my brother was dead.

1664-03-15 20:04 My brother began to fetch his spittle with more pain, till at last the phlegm getting the mastery of him, and he beginning to rattle.

1664-03-15 14:32 To my brother’s, where contrary to my expectation he continues as bad, talking idle, and now not at all knowing any of us as before.

1664-03-15 12:52 I sent for a barrel of oysters, and dined, and we were very merry, I being willing to be so upon this news.

1664-03-15 12:10 Dr Wiverly did talk with my brother, and he did wholly disclaim that ever he had the pox, or that ever he said to Mr. Powell that he had it.

1664-03-14 19:14 My brother talks no sense two words together now; and I confess it made me weepe to see that he should not be able to say who I was.

1664-03-14 14:24 My wife tells me in spiteful manner like a vixen, with a look full of rancour, she would buy a new dress and lace it and make me pay for it.

1664-03-14 14:08 At this my wife flounced away in a manner I never saw her, nor which I could ever endure.

1664-03-14 14:07 My wife and I fell out about my not being willing to have her gowne laced, but would lay out the same money and more on a plain new one.

1664-03-14 08:55 Upon the whole I do find my brother is, whether he lives or dies, a ruined man, and what trouble will befall me by it I know not.

1664-03-14 08:32 The mayde tells me many passages of her master’s practices, and how she concludes that he has run behind hand a great while and owes money.

1664-03-14 08:20 Up, and walked to my brother’s, where I find he hath continued talking idly all night, and now knows me not; which troubles me mightily.

1664-03-13 17:32 I walked home greatly troubled to think of my brother’s condition, and the trouble that would arise to me by his death or continuing sick.

1664-03-13 16:28 My brother Tom could only say that he knew me and then fell to other discourse, his face like a dying man, which Mrs Turner concludes he is.

1664-03-13 15:45 What is worst that my brother’s disease is the pox, which he hath heretofore got, and hath not been cured, but is come to this.

1664-03-13 15:42 Comes Mrs. Turner’s boy with a note to me to tell me that my brother Tom was so ill as they feared he would not long live.

1664-03-13 11:57 To my office, and there all the morning reading some Common Law, to which I will allot a little time now and then, for I much want it.

1664-03-12 16:22 Meeting Mr Stacy with some company of pretty women, I took him to a room by ourselves, and talked with him about the several sorts of tarrs.

1664-03-12 11:17 Vexed to see how Sir J. Minnes deserves rather to be pitied for his dotage than employed at a great salary to ruin the King’s business.

1664-03-11 22:15 Home to supper and to bed, hoping in God that my diligence, as it is really very useful for the King, so it will end in profit to myself.

1664-03-11 10:34 I find by discourse Mr. Moore to be grown rich, and indeed not to use me at all with the respect he used to do, but as his equal.

1664-03-10 15:35 Several persons, to the number of thirty-two, made the Duke’s assistants for their lives: whereof, by my Lord Sandwich’s favour, I am one.

1664-03-10 15:33 I found the Bill come for the Corporation of the Royall Fishery; whereof the Duke of Yorke is made present Governor.

1664-03-10 13:48 Home to dinner with my wife, to a good hog’s harslet, a piece of meat I love, but have not eat of I think these seven years.

1664-03-09 10:15 At my office finishing all things about Mr. Wood’s contract for masts, wherein I am sure I shall save the King 400l. before I have done.

1664-03-08 17:24 After good consultation and resolution of paying my forfeit, I do not find myself apprehensive that I have done any violence to my oaths.

1664-03-08 17:23 My conscience knows that it is only the saving of money and the time also that I intend by my oaths, and this has cost no more of either.

1664-03-08 17:22 We did walk home on purpose to make this going as cheap as that would have been, to have seen a play at Court.

1664-03-08 15:04 Though not exactly agreeing with the letter of my vowe, yet altogether with the sense, by going hither instead of that at Court.

1664-03-08 15:03 “Heraclius” being acted, which my wife and I have a mighty mind to see, we do resolve to see another this month.

1664-03-08 07:07 My wife was put upon puppy-dog water by a desire of my aunt Wight, who hath a mind, unknown to her husband, to get some for her ugly face.

1664-03-08 07:06 Up with some little discontent with my wife upon her saying that she had got and used some puppy-dog water.

1664-03-07 22:10 To bed, my cold being pretty well gone, but my eye remaining still snare and rhumey, which I wonder at, my right eye ayling nothing.

1664-03-07 17:40 It was pleasant to hear a lady hard by us, that did not know my Lady Castlemayne, say, being told who she was, that “she was well enough.”

1664-03-07 17:32 To the Duke’s house, where we saw “The Unfortunate Lovers;” but I was not much pleased with it, though I know not where to lay the fault.

1664-03-07 13:47 The Duke being gone abroad to-day, as we heard by a messenger, I spent the morning at my office writing fair my yesterday’s work.

1664-03-06 19:42 Sat all day in my closet at the office drawing up a second letter to Mr. Coventry about the measure of masts to my great satisfaction.

1664-03-05 21:22 My eye and my throat being very bad, and my cold increasing so as I could not speak almost. So home to supper, that is a posset, and to bed.

1664-03-05 09:52 To the office, where, though I had a great cold, I was forced to speak much upon a publique meeting of the East India Company.

1664-03-04 22:08 To bed, having a cold in my head and throat tonight from my late cutting my hair so close to my head, but I hope it will be soon gone again.

1664-03-04 15:32 I never had so much discourse with the Duke before, and till now did ever fear to meet him.

1664-03-04 15:19 Being met by the Duke of Yorke, he called me to him and discoursed a while with me about the new ship’s dispatch building at Woolwich.

1664-03-04 12:04 At Greenwich did observe the foundation laying of a very great house for the King, which will cost a great deale of money.

1664-03-04 09:18 There were several people by, trying a new-fashion gun brought my Lord, to shoot off often, one after another, without danger, very pretty.

1664-03-04 09:10 My Lord is concerned for the inconvenience upon my Lord Peterborough’s ill-stating of his matters, so as to have his gaine discovered.

1664-03-04 08:57 Up, my eye being pretty well, and then by coach to my Lord Sandwich, with whom I spoke, walking a good while with him in his garden.

1664-03-03 20:04 Home, being unwilling to stay late because of my eye which is not yet well of the rheum that is fallen down into it.

1664-03-03 14:54 But, Lord! to see how impatient I found myself within to see a play, I being at liberty once a month to see one.

1664-03-03 14:52 My wife and I out of doors thinking to have gone to have seen a play, but when we came to take coach, they tell us there are none this week.

1664-03-03 11:46 W. Howe assuring me of my Lord’s speaking so highly in my commendation to my Lord Peterborough and Povy.

1664-03-02 17:22 This afternoon we had a good present of tongues and bacon from Mr. Shales, of Portsmouth.

1664-03-02 11:32 Mr. Burgby finds things go very bad every where; and even in the Council nobody minds the publique.

1664-03-02 10:04 At St. Paul’s Churchyarde looked upon a pretty burlesque poem, called “Scarronides, or Virgile Travesty;” extraordinary good.

1664-03-02 06:55 Up, my eye mightily out of order with the rheum that is fallen down into it.

1664-03-01 22:39 I to my office, where late about getting myself a thorough understanding in the business of masts.

1664-03-01 20:02 Walked home by moonshine, it being mighty pleasant.

1664-03-01 14:56 I took Mr. Creed and my wife and down to Deptford, it being most pleasant weather.

1664-03-01 10:45 My uncle Wight told me how Mr. Maes had like to have been trapanned yesterday, but was forced to run for it.
