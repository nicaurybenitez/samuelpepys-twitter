1664-07-15 21:31 With my mind I bless God in good state of ease and body of health, only my head at this juncture full of business, how to get something.

1664-07-15 10:33 To White Hall; where there comes Mrs. Stewart, in a most lovely form, with her hair all about her eares, having her picture taking there.

1664-07-15 08:03 In the middle of our discourse my Lady Crew came in to bring my Lord word that he hath another son, my Lady being brought to bed just now.

1664-07-15 07:44 My Lord told me that his work is only to keep up his interest at Court, having little hope to get more. He hath now about 8,000l. per annum.

1664-07-15 07:29 I did give my Lord Sandwich an account of what had passed with my Lord Chancellor yesterday; with which he was well pleased.

1664-07-14 19:30 There has been so little ground for his jealousy of me, I am afeard that my Lord Chancellor do this to bring me to his side by scaring me.

1664-07-14 19:24 I think I did thoroughly appease my Lord Chancellor, till he thanked me for my desire and pains to satisfy him.

1664-07-14 19:22 My Lord Chancellor walked with me, I think, above an houre, talking most friendly, yet cunningly.

1664-07-14 13:34 He was confident upon my Lord Sandwich’s character of me, but he had reason to think what he did, and desired me to call upon him to-night.

1664-07-14 13:32 I to my Lord Chancellor’s; and I accosted him, telling him that I was the unhappy Pepys that had fallen into his high displeasure.

1664-07-14 07:44 All of which, I did assure my Lord, was most properly false, and nothing like it true; and told my Lord the whole passage.

1664-07-14 07:35 My Lord Chancellor said that I did most ungentlemanlike with him, and had justified rogues in cutting down a tree of his.

1664-07-14 07:34 In me, by a displeasure which my Lord Chancellor did show to him last night against me, in the most passionate manner any man did speak.

1664-07-14 07:32 My Lord Sandwich did begin with a profession of confidence in me, then told me what a misfortune was fallen upon me and him.

1664-07-14 06:03 Hearing a psalm sung, I went into St. Dunstan’s, and there heard prayers read, which, it seems, is done there every morning at six o’clock.

1664-07-13 12:50 I with Captain Ferrers to Mr. Barwell the King’s Squire Sadler, where about this time twelvemonths I dined before at a good venison pasty.

1664-07-13 12:03 I to my Lord Sandwich, thinking to have dined there, but they not dining at home.

1664-07-12 16:04 Mr Coventry and I to Blackwall and fine storehouses there are and good docks but of no great profit to him that oweth them for ought we see.

1664-07-12 13:30 Dined alone; sad for want of company and not being very well, and know not how to eat alone.

1664-07-12 00:13 At last Jane rose, and then I understand it was only the dogg wants a lodging and so made a noyse.

1664-07-11 23:58 These thoughts and fears I had, and do hence apprehend the fears of all rich men that are covetous and have much money by them.

1664-07-11 23:50 I rung, and could not make either of the wenches hear me, and this made me fear the more, lest they might be gag’d.

1664-07-11 23:23 Knowing what money I have in the house and hearing a noyse, I begun to sweat worse and worse, till I melted almost to water.

1664-07-11 23:14 I betimes to bed. And there fell into a most mighty sweat in the night.

1664-07-11 19:10 We rode home, round by Kingsland, Hackney, and Mile End till we were quite weary, and my water working at least 7 or 8 times upon the road.

1664-07-11 15:15 I and Will to see the Wells, half a mile off, and there I drank three glasses, and went and walked and came back and drunk two more.

1664-07-11 13:30 Here we staid two hours and then parted for all together, and my poor wife I shall soon want I am sure.

1664-07-11 11:03 By coach to Holborne, where they set out, and I and my man Will on horseback, by my wife, to Barnett; a very pleasant day.

1664-07-10 21:42 Home, and there my wife fell to putting things in order against her going to-morrow, and I to read, and so to bed, where I not well.

1664-07-10 13:20 By water to Somersett House, and walked to my Lord Sandwich’s, and there dined with my Lady and the children.

1664-07-09 22:10 To bed, where we have not lain together because of the heat of the weather a good while, but now against my wife going into the country.

1664-07-09 16:38 Home, by the way calling for my Chaucer and other books, and that is well done to my mind, which pleased me well.

1664-07-09 14:45 A great dispute we had; some, that we should swear to be true to the best of our power, and others to the best of our understanding.

1664-07-09 14:32 By coach with Sir J. Minnes to White Hall, and there to a Committee for Fishing; but the first thing was swearing to be true to the Company.

1664-07-08 18:38 To my office till 5 o’clock, and then came Mr. Hill and Andrews, and we sung an houre or two.

1664-07-08 11:20 To the binder’s and directed the doing of my Chaucer, though they were not neate enough; to the clasp-maker’s to have it clasped and bossed.

1664-07-08 08:11 I am concerned in hopes of the 50l. my Lord promised me, but I dare not reckon myself sure of it, for these Lords are hard to be trusted.

1664-07-07 22:07 Home and to bed, finding myself pretty well for all my waistecoate being put off to-day.

1664-07-07 17:19 I home, calling by the way for my new bookes, viz, Sir H. Spillman’s “Whole Glossary,” “Scapula’s Lexicon,” and Shakespeare’s plays.

1664-07-07 07:00 This day begun, the first day this year, to put off my linnen waistcoat, but it happening to be a cool day I was afraid of taking cold.

1664-07-06 21:15 The charge of the barge lies heavy upon me, which troubles me, but it is but once, and I may make Pierce do me some courtesy as great.

1664-07-06 20:59 Mrs. Clerke herself witty, but spoils all in making so great a flutter with a few fine clothes and some bad tawdry things worne with them.

1664-07-06 20:54 Mrs. Clerke’s kinswoman sings very prettily, but is very confident in it.

1664-07-06 20:50 Mrs. Pierce hath, I think, the best complexion that ever I saw on any woman, young or old, or child either, all days of my life.

1664-07-06 20:00 And so home to the Bridge, bringing night home with us.

1664-07-06 13:52 Come to the Hope and there showed them all the ships, and had a collacion of anchovies, gammon, &c.

1664-07-06 08:13 Mr Pierce and his wife, and a kinswoman and his sister, and Mrs Clerke and her sister and cozen were to expect us; so set out for the Hope.

1664-07-06 08:04 Having got some bottles of wine and beer and neat’s tongues, we went to our barge at the Towre.

1664-07-05 21:21 Full of thoughts of a sudden resolution this day taken upon the ’Change of going down to-morrow to the Hope.

1664-07-05 15:37 Much discourse with young Gregory about the Chest business, wherein Sir W. Batten is so great a knave.

1664-07-05 06:27 Went to bed discontented, and my wife came to bed to me, but all would not make me friends, but sleep and rise in the morning angry.

1664-07-04 19:04 The King and the Queene went to visit my Lord Sandwich and the fleete, going forth in the Hope.

1664-07-04 14:51 I followed Besse my wife’s messenger at the ‘Change, and sent her back; I would not have the pendantes changed, satisfied that she yielded.

1664-07-04 14:04 I vowed to breake the pendantes, or that she should go and get what she could for them again.

1664-07-04 13:57 It brought both me and my wife to very high and very foule words from her to me, such as trouble me to think she should have in her mouth.

1664-07-04 13:49 At home find my wife this day of her owne accord to have lain out 25s. upon a pair of pendantes for her eares, which did vex me.

1664-07-03 20:41 It thundering and lightning all the evening, and this yeare have had the most of thunder and lightning they say of any in man’s memory

1664-07-03 13:20 To dinner, where the remains of yesterday’s venison and a couple of brave green geese, which we are fain to eat alone.

1664-07-02 14:59 After dinner sat close to discourse about our business of the victualling of the garrison of Tangier.

1664-07-02 12:50 To the ’Change, and there I could meet with nobody that I could invite home to my venison pasty, but only Mr. Alsopp and Mr. Lanyon.

1664-07-01 21:10 We broke up with great pleasure, and very good company it is, and I hope I shall now and then have their company.

1664-07-01 19:04 By agreement came Mr. Hill and Andrews and one Cheswicke, a maister who plays very well upon the Spinette, and we sat singing Psalms.

1664-07-01 12:12 Dr. Burnett did write me down some direction what to do for it, but not with the satisfaction I expected.

1664-07-01 12:10 Dr. Burnett assures me that I have an ulcer either in the kidneys or bladder, for my water, he is sure the sediment is a direct pusse.

1664-07-01 11:45 Within all the morning, first bringing down my Tryangle to my chamber below, having a new frame made proper for it to stand on.
