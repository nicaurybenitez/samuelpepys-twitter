1664-12-16 14:33 Abroad with my wife, and bought a looking glasse by the Old Exchange, which costs me 5l. 5s. and 6s. for the hooks. A very fair glasse.

1664-12-16 09:29 I am well informed that Mr. Castle’s fine knees, lately delivered in, are not as they should be to make them knees.

1664-12-15 21:44 I begun to burn wax candles in my closett at the office, to try the charge and to see whether the smoke offends like that of tallow candles.
.
1664-12-15 11:12 To the Coffeehouse, where great talke of the Comet seen in several places; and among our men at sea, and by my Lord Sandwich.

1664-12-15 09:55 To Moorfields, and up and down to several houses to look for a place ‘pour rencontrer la femme de je sais quoi’, but could meet none.

1664-12-15 08:47 Mr. Cholmly tells me the King do hate my Lord Chancellor; and that the King and my Lord FitzHarding do laugh at him for a dull fellow.

1664-12-15 08:10 It seems, of all mankind there is no man so led by another as the Duke is by Lord Muskerry and this FitzHarding.

1664-12-14 23:02 Home to supper and to bed, not being very well through my taking cold of late, and so troubled with some wind.

1664-12-14 19:28 I spoke for some fruit for my father, and where should I do it but at the pretty woman’s that used to stand at the door in Fanchurch Street.

1664-12-14 09:58 To my bookseller’s, and there spoke for several books against New Year’s day, I resolving to lay out about 7l. or 8l.

1664-12-13 08:58 Lay long in bed, then up, and many people to speak with me.

1664-12-12 15:20 Comes Cutler to tell us that the King of France hath forbid any canvass to be carried out of his kingdom.

1664-12-12 14:32 To the office, where my Lord Brunkard reads over our Instructions in the Navy — and I expounded it to him, so he is become my disciple.

1664-12-11 16:40 It is strange how these Psalms of Ravenscroft after 2 or 3 times singing prove but the same again. No diversity appearing at all almost.

1664-12-11 16:17 Home, and there found Mr. Andrews and his lady, a well-bred and a tolerable pretty woman, and by and by Mr. Hill and to singing.

1664-12-11 15:42 Here was Sir Samuel Morland and his lady very fine, with two footmen in new liverys, going into their coach after sermon with great gazeing.

1664-12-11 15:20 To the French church, where much pleased with the three sisters of the parson, very handsome, especially in their noses, and sing prettily.

1664-12-10 14:03 Hearing newes of so many Dutchmen being brought in to Portsmouth, which it is expected will either put them upon present revenge or despair.

1664-12-10 12:28 A modest civil person my Lord Brunkard seems to be, but wholly ignorant in the business of the Navy as possible.

1664-12-10 07:48 Lay long, at which I am ashamed, because of so many people observing it that know not how late I sit up.

1664-12-10 01:14 To my office, setting to rights in writing this day’s two accounts of Povy and Taylor, and then quietly to bed.

1664-12-09 15:29 Though I took occasion of going to the Trumpet Jane declined coming. ‘Je avait grande envie envers elle, avec vrai amour et passion’.

1664-12-09 15:27 I to Westminster Hall, and thence to Gervas’s, and there find I cannot prevail with Jane to go forth with me.

1664-12-09 10:15 Captain Taylor and I did set even the business of the ship Union, wherein I hope to get 50l. more, for all which the Lord be praised.

1664-12-09 08:17 It overbears me on one side with joy and on the other to think of my condition if I shall be called into examination about it.

1664-12-09 08:15 To Mr. Povy’s. I got a note, and went and received 117l. 5s. of Alderman Viner upon my pretended freight of the “William” for Tangier.

1664-12-08 20:05 Comes my aunt and uncle Wight, Mrs. Norbury, and her daughter, where no great pleasure, my aunt being out of humour in her fine clothes.

1664-12-07 15:32 To White Hall, and we waited on the Duke, who looks better than he did before his voyage; and a little more stern than he used to do.

1664-12-07 09:20 Lay long, then up, and among others Bagwell’s wife coming to speak with me put new thoughts of folly into me which I am troubled at.

1664-12-06 12:57 Mrs. Lane is great with child, and she says I must be godfather, but I do not intend it.

1664-12-06 12:55 After many discourses and Mrs. Lane intreating me to do something for her husband, which I promised to do, I took leave.

1664-12-06 12:45 I made Mrs. Lane go home, and by and by followed her, and there did what I would with her.

1664-12-06 12:11 To Westminster Hall. Mrs. Lane plucks me by the cloak to speak to me, and I was fain to go to her shop, and pretending to buy some bands.

1664-12-05 20:02 I to White Hall, and there saw Mr. Coventry come to towne, and, with all my heart, am glad to see him, but could have no talke with him

1664-12-05 18:40 I find Mrs. The., but not as I expected, but pleased I am to hear the mother commend her daughter Betty that she is like to be a beauty.

1664-12-05 18:15 We all, it being night, in Madam Turner’s coach to her house, there to see, as she tells us, how fat Mrs. The. is grown.

1664-12-05 09:50 Up, and to White Hall with Sir J. Minnes; and there, among an infinite crowd of great persons, did kiss the Duke’s hand.

1664-12-04 09:12 Lay long in bed, and then up and to my office, there to dispatch a business in order to the getting something out of the Tangier business.

1664-12-03 16:45 The Dutch are all drawn into their harbours. But it seems like a victory: and a matter of some reputation to us it is, and blemish to them.

1664-12-03 16:36 The Duke of Yorke being expected to-night with great joy from Portsmouth after having been abroad at sea three or four days with the fleete.

1664-12-03 15:25 My Lord Barkeley was there, but is the most hot, fiery man in discourse, without any cause, that ever I saw.

1664-12-03 15:15 To a Committee of the Fishery; only to hear Sir Edward Ford’s proposal about farthings wherein, O God! to see every body interested for him.

1664-12-02 20:20 Sat and talked, where good discourse of the late troubles, they knowing things, all of them, very well.

1664-12-02 19:15 To my office, whither comes Captain Cocke, and then Sir W. Batten, and we all to Sir J. Minnes, and I did give them a barrel of oysters.

1664-12-02 17:50 Homeward, and the coach broke with us in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and so walked to Fleete Streete, and there took coach and home.

1664-12-02 17:10 To the Duke’s House, and saw “The Rivalls”; but the play not good, nor anything but the good actings of Betterton and his wife and Harris.

1664-12-01 09:10 Up betimes and to White Hall to a Committee of Tangier, and so straight home and hard to my business at my office.
