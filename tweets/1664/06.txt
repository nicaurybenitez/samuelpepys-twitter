1664-06-16 00:38 At the last house, at last, we found some people drinking and roaring; and there got in, and after drinking, got an ill bed.

1664-06-16 00:07 Into the towne, Creed and I; and to several houses, inns, but could get no lodging, all being in bed.

1664-06-15 23:37 We came safe, however, to their house, where all were abed. So put them into doors; and leaving them with the mayds, bade them good night.

1664-06-15 22:48 Lord! the fear that my Lady Paulina was in every step of the way; and indeed at this time of the night it was no safe thing to go that road.

1664-06-15 22:35 I sent my wife home by coach with Mr. Creed’s boy; and myself and Creed in the coach home with the ladies.

1664-06-15 21:55 We waited for the young ladies, their coach; but it being so late, I doubted what to do how to get them home.

1664-06-15 20:32 To the Cherry Garden, and then by water singing finely to the Bridge, and there landed; and so took boat again, and to Somersett House.

1664-06-15 18:23 By water down to Greenwich; and up to the top of the hill, and there played upon the ground at cards.

1664-06-15 14:04 Comes Mr Creed, and the three young ladies: and merry we were with our pasty; and a dish of roasted chickens; pease, lobsters, strawberries.

1664-06-14 17:28 Into Sir H Finche’s garden, and a mighty fine cool place it is, with a great laver of water in the middle and the bravest place for musique.

1664-06-14 16:03 She is a woman of such an ayre, as I wonder the less at my Lord’s favour to her, and I warrant him she hath brains enough to entangle him.

1664-06-14 15:58 She hath not one good feature in her face, and yet is a fine lady, of a fine taille, and very well carriaged, and mighty discreet.

1664-06-14 15:55 Much company came hither, my Lady Carteret, &c, Sir William Wheeler and his lady, and, Mr. Becke and wife and daughter, my Lord’s mistress.

1664-06-14 14:30 By coach to Kensington, to my Lady Sandwich, who hath lain this fortnight here at Deane Hodges’s.

1664-06-14 11:52 To the office, and had great conflict about the flags again, but however I stop the King’s being abused by the flag makers for the present.

1664-06-13 19:28 Having a gally down to Greenwich, and there saw the King’s works a-doing there, and so to the Cherry Garden, and carried some cherries home.

1664-06-13 14:49 Mr. Coventry proposed to me the writing of the History of the late Dutch warr, which, if well done, may recommend me much.

1664-06-13 05:55 I rated at Captain Taylor, whom I found a lying and a very stupid blundering fellow, good for nothing and of no judgment or dispatch at all.

1664-06-12 21:48 My wife made great means to be friends, coming to my bedside and doing all things to please me and I could not hold out, but seemed pleased.

1664-06-12 16:52 Without any the least cause my wife had the cunning to cry a great while, and talk and blubber, which made me mighty angry in mind.

1664-06-12 16:49 We to the Half-way house, and there eat and drank, and upon a very small occasion had a difference again broke out.

1664-06-12 15:22 Then the question was whether my wife should go, and she having dressed herself, was angry and began to talk of my keeping her within doors.

1664-06-12 15:10 My wife and I began our great dispute about going to Griffin’s child’s christening, where I was to have been godfather.

1664-06-11 19:33 To my office vexed with Captain Taylor about the delay of carrying down the ship hired by me for Tangier.

1664-06-11 17:15 At Hackney ’light, and played at shuffle-board, eat cream and good churies; and so with good refreshment home.

1664-06-11 15:07 By coach with my wife only to take the ayre, it being very warm and pleasant, to Bowe and Old Ford; and thence to Hackney.

1664-06-11 10:52 Some discourse arose from Sir G Carteret and Mr Coventry, which gives me occasion to think that something like a war is expected now indeed.

1664-06-10 09:43 Walked with Capt. Sylas Taylor and Dr Whore, talking of musique, and particularly of Mr Berckenshaw’s way, which Taylor magnifies mightily.

1664-06-09 20:42 I think all the world is grown false.

1664-06-08 22:05 In my study writing of my old broken office notes in shorthand all in one book, till my eyes did ake ready to drop out.

1664-06-08 13:22 My Lord, who sent his daughters thither, will come under pretence to see them, and pack them out of doors, and stay behind with Mrs. Becke.

1664-06-08 13:20 Creed do tell me that my Lord’s daughters do perceive all, and do hate Chelsea, and the young woman there, Mrs. Betty Becke.

1664-06-07 08:10 Up and to the office (having by my going by water without any thing upon my legs yesterday got some pain upon me again).

1664-06-06 22:05 I found my wife a little better. A little to my office, then home to supper and to bed.

1664-06-06 20:26 I find myself every day become more and more known, and shall one day hope to have benefit by it.

1664-06-06 14:15 To Trinity House. A great dinner. Mr. Prin would not drink any health, no, not the King’s, but sat down with his hat on all the while.

1664-06-06 10:04 To Deptford, and found our Trinity Brethren come from their election to church, where Dr. Britton made, methought, an indifferent sermon.

1664-06-06 06:32 Up and found my wife very ill again, which troubles me, but I was forced to go forth.

1664-06-05 19:44 All the afternoon with my wife discoursing and talking, and in the evening to my office doing business.

1664-06-05 01:24 My wife is very ill. From some cold she got to-day, or from something else, she is taken with great gripings, a looseness, and vomiting.

1664-06-04 17:04 So to the Committee for Tangier all afternoon, where still the same confused doings. It grieves me to see how brokenly things are ordered.

1664-06-04 09:42 Giving the Duke an account of the necessity of a power to presse seamen, without which we cannot raise men for this fleete of twelve sayle.

1664-06-03 17:52 Prince Rupert do nothing but swear and laugh a little, with an oathe or two, and that’s all he do.

1664-06-03 17:47 At the Committee for Tangier all the afternoon, where a sad consideration to see things of so great weight managed in so confused a manner.

1664-06-03 12:14 We sat at the office extraordinary upon the business of our stores. Lord! what a pitiful account the Surveyor makes of it grieves my heart.

1664-06-02 22:32 To supper and bed, being now in constant pain in my back, but whether it be only wind or what it is the Lord knows, but I fear the worst.

1664-06-02 14:04 To White Hall to a Committee of Tangier about providing provisions, money, and men for Tangier.

1664-06-01 16:32 Before the play was done, it fell such a storm of hayle that we in the middle of the pit were fain to rise; and all the house in a disorder.

1664-06-01 16:10 To the King’s house, and saw “The Silent Woman;” but methought not so well done or so good a play as I formerly thought it to be.

1664-06-01 09:34 I down by water to Woolwich and Deptford, reading Mr. Spencer’s Book of Prodigys, which is most ingeniously writ, both for matter and style.

1664-06-01 08:25 Mr. Hollyard has brought me something to dissolve the stone, which do make me very much troubled, and pray to God to ease me.

1664-06-01 08:20 Mr. Hollyard came to me, and after his assuring me that I could not have the stone again, he tells me that he do fear that I have it again.
