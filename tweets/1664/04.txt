1664-04-15 17:40 Never was any thing so well done in earnest, worse performed in jest upon the stage.

1664-04-15 17:38 With my wife by coach to the Duke’s house, and there saw “The German Princess” acted, by the woman herself.

1664-04-15 12:43 I met with Mr. Hill, with whom, I perceive, I shall contract a musical acquaintance; but I will make it as little troublesome as I can.

1664-04-15 11:06 I showed Captain Taylor my letters to Mr. Coventry, wherein he acknowledges that nobody did ever understand so much as I have done.

1664-04-14 19:42 My mind a little vexed, but yet without reason, for I shall prevail, I hope, for the King’s profit.

1664-04-14 08:22 With Mr. Coventry and Povy, &c, about my Lord Peterborough’s accounts, but, Lord! to see still what a puppy that Povy is with all his show.

1664-04-14 06:51 I took leave of my father, being much afeard I shall not see him here any more, he do decay so much every day.

1664-04-13 10:48 Mr. Coventry says those that are forward for a warr, they are reported in the world to be designers of getting money into the King’s hands.

1664-04-13 10:30 To talk of our business with the Dutch; Mr. Coventry tells me fully that he believes it will not come to a warr.

1664-04-12 16:27 To Mr. Pagett’s, and heard some musique not very good, but only one Dr. Walgrave, who plays the best upon the lute that I ever heard man.

1664-04-12 13:33 How I used to adore Mr. Cole’s talke, and now methinks he is but an ordinary man, his son a pretty boy indeed, but his nose unhappily awry.

1664-04-12 12:42 To my uncle Wight’s, where dined my father, poor melancholy man, that used to be as full of life as anybody.

1664-04-12 10:24 I would be glad to get W. Howe secretary and to out Creed if I can, for he is a crafty and false rogue.

1664-04-12 10:12 W. Howe and I to the Coffee-house, where we sat talking about getting of him some place under my Lord of advantage if he should go to sea.

1664-04-11 14:08 Dined at home, being myself not yet thorough well, making water with some pain, but better than I was, and all my fear of an ague gone away.

1664-04-10 18:32 We spent the day in pleasant talks and company one with another, reading in Dr. Fuller’s book what he says of the Cliffords and Kingsmills.

1664-04-10 11:40 My wife’s taylor brought home her new laced silks gowns with a smaller lace, and new petticoats, I bought the other day both very pretty.

1664-04-10 10:32 I not being so well as to go out, my wife, though much against her will, staid at home with me.

1664-04-10 07:02 By the help of Mithrydate I slept very well.

1664-04-09 20:43 I drank a glass or two of Hypocras, and to the office to dispatch some business, necessary, and so home and to bed.

1664-04-09 19:20 To my father’s and spoke one word with him, and thence home, where I found myself sick in my stomach and vomited, which I do not use to do.

1664-04-09 12:10 I continued cold and apt to shake all the morning.

1664-04-09 06:15 I did wake about one o’clock in the morning, and pissed with great pain, continued sleepy, but in a high fever all night, and in some pain.

1664-04-08 22:04 To walk in the garden with my wife, and to my office a while, and then to the only Lenten supper I have had of wiggs and ale, and so to bed.

1664-04-08 13:24 I put into a cane shop and bought one to walk with, cost me 4s. 6d., all of one joint.

1664-04-07 14:45 To dinner, where my wife got me a pleasant French fricassee of veal for dinner, and thence to the office.

1664-04-07 13:03 Talke of the Dutch’s protest against our Royall Company in Guinny and their granting letters of marke against us. Every body expects a warr.

1664-04-06 12:22 I all the morning in my office busy, and at noon home to dinner mightily oppressed with wind.

1664-04-06 08:25 She was brought to bed in St. Sepulchre’s parish of two children; one is dead, the other is alive; her name Elizabeth, and goes by Taylor.

1664-04-06 08:20 My father’s old servant told me he had been serviceable to my brother Tom, in the business of his getting his servant, Margaret, with child.

1664-04-05 17:45 The poor wretch took it ill, and I believe besides wringing her nose she did feel pain, and so cried, but by and by I made her friends.

1664-04-05 17:32 My wife answering me some way that I did not like I pulled her by the nose, to offend her, though afterwards to appease her I denied it.

1664-04-05 15:58 I went to W. Joyce, where I find the order come, and bayle given; and he paying his fees: which, I hope, will teach him to hold his tongue.

1664-04-05 13:03 I heard the King’s speech to the House; but he speaks the worst that ever I heard man in my life, worse than if he read it all.

1664-04-05 12:12 At last it was carried that W. Joyce should be bayled till the House meets again after Easter, he giving bond for his appearance.

1664-04-05 11:22 Lord Peterborough presented a petition to the House from W. Joyce: and a great dispute, we hear, there was in the House for and against it.

1664-04-05 09:50 I staid an hour or two and wrote over a fresh petition, that which was drawn by their solicitor not pleasing me.

1664-04-05 08:00 With Anthony Joyce to his brother Will, where I find him pretty cheery over he was yesterday (like a coxcomb), his wife being come to him.

1664-04-04 14:20 To the Duke’s, where discourse of the condition of the Fleete, in order to a Dutch warr, for that the Duke hath a mind it should come to.

1664-04-04 11:32 Who would have thought that W Joyce should be so daunted as not to know what he said, and now to cry like a child. It is strange to observe.

1664-04-04 11:10 The Sergeant of the Black Rod did direct a messenger to take W. Joyce in custody, and so he was conducted to the Swan with two Necks.

1664-04-04 10:59 W. Joyce was called in; and I find he did speak all he said to his disadvantage, and so was committed to the Black Rod: which is very hard.

1664-04-04 10:35 I saw my Lady Peters, an impudent jade, soliciting all the Lords on her behalf.

1664-04-04 10:27 To Westminster, to the Painted Chamber, and met the two Joyces. I to the Lords’ House before they sat; and stood within it a good while.

1664-04-04 09:02 I can yet discern a coldness in my Lord Sandwich to admit me to any discourse with him.

1664-04-03 16:10 My wife sent for me, to see her new laced gowne, that is her gown that is new laced; and indeed it becomes her very nobly, and is well made.

1664-04-03 10:32 W. Joyce’s business was to ask advice of me, he being summonsed to the House of Lords for endeavouring to arrest my Lady Peters for a debt.

1664-04-02 16:15 Looking over two ships now in building, and am resolved to learn something of the art, for I find it is not hard and very usefull.

1664-04-02 13:45 Sir Thomas Chamberlin tells me that it is very probable, as well as most necessary, that we fall out with the Dutch.

1664-04-02 12:53 It is hard not only to tell how we know when we do a thing really or in a dream, but also to know the difference between one and the other.

1664-04-02 12:52 Discourse with Sir W. Petty, who proposed a thing that is truly questionable, whether there be any difference between waking and dreaming.

1664-04-02 09:10 That doating fool Sir J. Minnes says whatever Sir W. Batten says, though never minding whether to the King’s profit or not.

1664-04-01 20:48 I was at it to-night, but durst not stay long at it, I being come to have a great pain and water in my eyes after candle-light.

1664-04-01 17:57 Mrs. Turner did lend me a manuscript of one Mr. Wells, writ long ago, teaching the method of building a ship, which pleases me mightily.

1664-04-01 15:42 The Duke of York called me to him. I perceive doth much wish that the Parliament will find reason to fall out with the Dutch.

1664-04-01 15:04 I saw the Queene going to the Parke: she herself looks ill, and methinks Mrs. Stewart is grown fatter, and not so fair as she was.

1664-04-01 12:35 To the ’Change. I found all the merchants concerned with the presenting their complaints to the Committee of Parliament against the Dutch.
