1664-10-16 21:47 Home, parting company at my cozen Anth. Joyce’s, by four o’clock, weary, but very well, to bed at home, where I find all well.

1664-10-16 13:38 Staid not in the Church, but thence mounted again and to Barnett by the end of sermon, and there dined at the Red Lyon very weary again.

1664-10-16 09:04 Got to Hatfield in church-time; and I ‘light and saw my simple Lord Salsbury sit there in his gallery.

1664-10-15 22:12 I find that eating after I come to my Inne, without drinking, do keep me from being stomach sick, which drink do presently make me.

1664-10-15 21:58 I weary, which proceeded from our galloping so much; but I find that a coney skin in my breeches preserves me perfectly from galling.

1664-10-15 19:07 Taking leave, W. Joyce and I set out, calling T. Trice at Bugden, and thence got by night to Stevenage, and there mighty merry.

1664-10-15 10:20 My mother all to no purpose desiring me to be friends with John, but I told her I cannot, nor indeed shall, which afflicted the poor woman.

1664-10-15 07:48 My father and I up and walked alone to Hinchingbroke; and saw the water-works and the Oral which is very fine; and so is the house all over.

1664-10-14 21:58 Home, where W. Joyce full of talk and pleased with his journey, and after supper I to bed and left my father, mother, and him laughing.

1664-10-14 17:50 My father and I to the Court, and did all our business to my mind, as I have set down in a paper particularly expressing our proceedings.

1664-10-14 15:32 Got to Brampton by three o’clock, where my father and mother overjoyed to see me, my mother, ready to weepe every time she looked upon me.

1664-10-13 21:10 Very merrily rode till it was darke, I leading the way through the darke to Welling, and there, not being very weary, to supper and to bed.

1664-10-13 15:10 To the Red Lyon in Aldersgate Street, and there met W. Joyce and Tom Trice, and mounted, I upon a fine mare that Sir W. Warren helps me to.

1664-10-13 14:14 I home and dined, and taking leave of my wife with my mind not a little troubled how she would look after herself or house in my absence.

1664-10-12 22:15 At my office late doing business against my journey to clear my hands of every thing for two days.

1664-10-12 12:52 All say De Ruyter is gone to Guinny before us. Sir J. Lawson is come to Portsmouth; and our fleete is hastening all speed.

1664-10-11 21:47 My wife tells me the sad news of my Lady Castlemayne’s being now become so decayed, that one would not know her; at least far from a beauty.

1664-10-11 16:07 To Will Joyce to get him to go to Brampton with me, but he will not, and I am not sorry, for his company both chargeable and troublesome.

1664-10-11 13:32 Luellin tells me what a bawdy play this “Parson’s Wedding” is, that is acted by nothing but women at the King’s house, and I am glad of it.

1664-10-10 21:12 Bless God for our long lives and loves and health together, which the same God long continue, I wish, from my very heart!

1664-10-10 21:10 This day my wife and I have been married nine years: but my head being full of business I did not keep it in any extraordinary manner.

1664-10-10 11:50 Sir W. Batten did discover the reason of Sir J. Minnes’ so long discontent with him, and now they are friends again, which I am sorry for.

1664-10-10 09:30 More preparations every day appear against the Dutch, and (which do a little move my envy) Sir W. Pen do grow more regarded by the Duke.

1664-10-09 19:40 My aunt and uncle in a very ill humour one with another, but I made shift with much ado to keep them from scolding.

1664-10-09 15:15 To church, and there staid to gaze upon a pretty lady, and dogged her home, and I think her to be one of the prettiest women I ever saw.

1664-10-08 23:58 Arguing about the freight of Captain Tayler’s ship, and at last we made an end, and I hope to get a little money, some small matter by it.

1664-10-08 14:20 I contracted with Mr. Bridges for 100 pieces of Callico to make flaggs; I shall save the King money, so I hope to get a little for my pains.

1664-10-07 17:07 Mr. Cocker brought me a globe of glasse, and a frame of oyled paper, as I desired, to show me the manner of his gaining light to grave by.

1664-10-07 15:10 Abroad to look after callicos for flags, and hope to get a small matter by my pains therein and yet save the King a great deal of money.

1664-10-07 07:40 Lay with some discontent abed, even to the having bad words with my wife, and blows too, about the ill-serving up of our victuals yesterday.

1664-10-06 11:28 To the office, where busy, among other things about this of the flags and my bringing in of callicos to oppose Young and Whistler.

1664-10-05 18:10 After three hours’ stay the Arched Viall could not be fixed in tune; and so they were fain to go to some other musique of instruments.

1664-10-05 15:30 The new instrument was brought called the Arched Viall, where being tuned with lute-strings, and played on with kees like an organ.

1664-10-05 15:15 To the Musique-meeting at the Postoffice. And thither anon come all the Gresham College, and a great deal of noble company.

1664-10-05 14:40 I discoursed with Mr. Cocker about his ability of sight, and how I shall do to get some glasse or other to helpe my eyes by candlelight.

1664-10-05 09:25 I did with pleasure see the many pretty works, and the little children employed, every one to do something, which was a very fine sight.

1664-10-05 09:15 By coach to New Bridewell to meet with Mr Poyntz to discourse with him (being Master of the Workhouse there) about making of Bewpers for us.

1664-10-04 17:20 To-morrow they told us should be acted, or the day after, a new play, called “The Parson’s Dreame,” acted all by women.

1664-10-04 17:15 I home with my wife and Mercer, vexed at my losing my time and above 20s. in money, and neglecting my business to see so bad a play.

1664-10-04 16:41 I happened to sit near to Sir Charles Sidly; and he did at every line take notice of the dullness of the poet and badness of the action.

1664-10-04 16:38 To a play, to see “The Generall;” which is so dull and so ill-acted, that I think it is the worst I ever saw or heard in all my days.

1664-10-04 11:47 Sir W. Pen went to Chatham to look after the ships now going out thence, and particularly that wherein the Duke and himself go.

1664-10-03 16:57 We made an experiment of Holland’s and our cordage, and ours outdid it a great deale, as my book of observations tells particularly.

1664-10-03 12:18 Bagwell’s wife rebuked me for doing kissing her, saying that did I do so much to many bodies else it would be a stain to me.

1664-10-03 12:15 Meeting Bagwell’s wife at the office before I went home I took her into the office and there kissed her only.

1664-10-03 08:49 Talke of great haste in the getting out another fleete; it is likely we have put one another by each other’s dalliance past a retreate.

1664-10-03 08:28 Up with Sir J. Minnes, by coach, to St. James’s; and there all the newes now of very hot preparations for the Dutch.

1664-10-02 16:04 I walked home, and there my wife was angry with me for not coming home, and for gadding abroad to look after beauties, she told me plainly.

1664-10-02 11:50 I walked to my Lady Sandwich’s, through my Lord Southampton’s new buildings in the fields behind Gray’s Inn; and they are a noble work.

1664-10-02 09:15 The fair Butler is a beauty I do admire myself for my choice of her for a beauty, having the best lower part of her face that ever I saw.

1664-10-02 09:10 To Clerkenwell church, and there, as I wished, sat next pew to the fair Butler, who indeed is a most perfect beauty still.

1664-10-01 20:37 We go now on in preparing against the Dutch, who will fall upon us without doubt upon this newes of our beating them so wholly in Guinny.

1664-10-01 09:54 I sent Mrs. Lane an answer that I would see her at Westminster, and so I did not go, and she went away, poor soul.

1664-10-01 09:50 Mrs. Lane (now Martin) like a foolish woman, sent for me while I was at the office, I know to get me to do something for her husband.
