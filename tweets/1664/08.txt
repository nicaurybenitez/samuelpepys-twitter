1664-08-16 05:15 I find not one drop of rain in my house, nor any newes of hurt done.

1664-08-16 05:05 I expected to find my house overflowed with the rain, and that much hurt must needs have been done in the city with this lightning.

1664-08-16 02:58 For a great while, not a minute’s space between new flames all the time; such a thing as I never did see.

1664-08-16 02:55 Wakened with the noise of thunder, with such continued lightnings, not flashes, but flames, that all the sky and ayre was light.

1664-08-15 17:57 It is true, the Dutchman wears high-heeled shoes, but not very high, and do generally wear a turbant, which makes him show yet taller.

1664-08-15 17:55 At Charing Crosse saw the great Dutchman that is come over, and I could not reach higher than his eye-browes with the tip of my fingers.

1664-08-15 16:22 Let Mrs. Lane brew as she has baked, seeing she would not take my counsel about Hawly.

1664-08-15 16:20 I had my pleasure Mrs. Lane, and she, like an impudent jade, depends upon my kindness to her husband but I will have no more to do with her.

1664-08-15 15:52 There begins a sad story how Mrs. Lane’s husband, as I feared, proves not worth a farthing, and that she is with child and undone.

1664-08-15 09:20 The Duke tells us how we must presently set out a fleete for Guinny, for the Dutch are doing so, and there I believe the warr will begin.

1664-08-14 20:10 W. Joyce supped with me; but a cunning, crafty fellow he is, and dangerous to displease, for his tongue spares nobody.

1664-08-14 18:29 Comes W. Joyce, in his silke suit, and cloake lined with velvett: staid talking with me, and I very merry at it.

1664-08-14 15:15 My wife and I with great pleasure, but with great difficulty before we could come to find the manner of seeing any thing by my microscope.

1664-08-14 08:34 And that I am not at all troubled with any ulcer, but my thickness of water comes from my overheat in my back.

1664-08-14 08:33 Mr. Holliard concurs with me that my pain is nothing but cold in my legs breeding wind, and got only by my using to wear a gowne.

1664-08-13 21:30 To read a little in Dr. Power’s book of discovery by the Microscope to enable me a little how to use and what to expect from my glasse.

1664-08-13 17:10 Betterton, Harris, and Ianthe’s parts are most incomparably done, and the whole play the most full of height and raptures of wit and sense.

1664-08-13 17:07 To the new play, at the Duke’s house, of “Henry the Fifth;” a most noble play, writ by my Lord Orrery

1664-08-13 13:41 I got Mr Creed to give me a play, lending him money to do it, a fallacy I have found to avoyde my vowe with but never to be more practised.

1664-08-13 06:56 The other Mr. Reeve gives me, and is of value; and a curious curiosity it is to look objects in a darke room with.

1664-08-13 06:54 For the first I did give him 5l. 10s, a great price, but a most curious bauble it is, and as good, nay, the best he knows in England.

1664-08-13 06:52 There comes also Mr. Reeve, with a microscope and scotoscope.

1664-08-13 06:20 Comes my Taylor with a coate to wear within doors, to come no lower than my knees, for by wearing a gowne comes my tenderness about my legs.

1664-08-12 22:15 Our poor Fancy, to my great grief, continues lame still so that I wish she had not been brought home again, for it troubles me to see her.

1664-08-12 21:44 Home. Though late, yet Pedro being there, he sang a song and parted. I did give him 5s but find it burdensome and will break up the meeting.

1664-08-12 10:51 Busy at the office with Sir W. Warren about a contract for New England masts, where I was very hard with him, even to the making him angry.

1664-08-11 22:10 I late to my office, and cannot forbear admiring and consulting my new rule, and so home to supper and to bed.

1664-08-11 19:15 For a wager before the King, my Lords of Castlehaven and Arran, they two alone did run down and kill a stoute bucke in St. James’s parke.

1664-08-11 16:27 Home, whither comes Cocker with my rule, which he hath engraved to admiration: it cost me 14s. the doing, and mightily pleased I am with it.

1664-08-11 13:51 Mr. Creed, lately come from the Downes, dined with me. I show him a good countenance, but love him not for his base ingratitude to me.

1664-08-11 09:47 A high dispute against Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen about the breadth of canvas again, they being for the making of it narrower.

1664-08-11 05:04 Up, and through pain, to my great grief forced to wear my gowne to keep my legs warm.

1664-08-10 10:28 Strange it is to see Cocker with his natural eyes to cut so small at his first designing it, and read it all over, without any missing.

1664-08-10 09:53 I find out Cocker, the famous writing-master, and get him to do it.

1664-08-10 09:10 Abroad to do several small businesses, among others to find out one to engrave my tables upon my new sliding rule with silver plates.

1664-08-09 18:30 The Emperour hath beat the Turke; killed the Grand Vizier and several great Bassas, with an army of 80,000 men killed and routed.

1664-08-09 16:04 To my office and my head being a little troubled with the little wine I drank, though mixed with beer, but it may be more than I used to do.

1664-08-09 14:57 Mr. Blagrave and I a little talke by ourselves of his kinswoman that is to come to live with my wife, who is to come about ten days hence.

1664-08-08 17:39 We saw “Flora’s Figarys.” By the most ingenuous performance of the young jade Flora, it seemed as pretty a pleasant play as ever I saw.

1664-08-08 15:10 My wife and I to the King’s play-house, she giving me her time of the last month, she having not seen any then; so my vowe is not broke.

1664-08-08 14:38 Home to dinner, and after dinner to hang up my fine pictures in my dining room, which makes it very pretty.

1664-08-07 17:21 I would to God they would either conform, or be more wise, and not be catched!

1664-08-07 17:20 Came by several poor creatures carried by by constables, for being at a conventicle. They go like lambs, without any resistance.

1664-08-07 17:10 Mr. Spong tell me that by his microscope he do discover that the wings of a moth is made just as the feathers of the wing of a bird.

1664-08-07 16:55 Mr. Spong talking of many ingenuous things, musique, and at last of glasses, and I find him still the same ingenuous man that ever he was.

1664-08-07 15:42 I met Mr. Blagrave, who gives a report of the boy, and I spoke to him, and he seems a willing boy to come to me, and I hope will do well.

1664-08-07 14:33 At home met with a letter of Captain Cooke’s, with which he had sent a boy for me to see, whom he did intend to recommend to me.

1664-08-07 11:47 I showed my wife, to her great joy, Mr. Gauden’s present of plate, the two flaggons, that I hardly can think that they are yet mine.

1664-08-07 09:10 My wife telling me sad stories of the ill, improvident, disquiett, and sluttish manner that my father and mother and Pall live.

1664-08-06 19:22 We ‘light in Holborne, and by another coach my wife and mayde home, and I by horseback, and found all things most mighty neate and clean.

1664-08-06 14:30 Here very merry as being weary I could be, and after dinner, out again, and to London.

1664-08-06 12:15 We mounted and away with them to Welling, and there ‘light, and dined very well and merry and glad to see my poor-wife.

1664-08-06 08:03 W. Joyce and I to a game at bowles on the green, and then comes my wife in the coach.

1664-08-06 01:15 W. Joyce comes into my chamber, with a note from my wife, that she was come by Yorke coach to Bigglesworth, and would be with us to-morrow.

1664-08-05 21:40 To my great trouble, find that my wife was not come, nor any Stamford coach gone down this week, so that she cannot come.

1664-08-05 21:10 To Barnett, and there drank, and so by night to Stevenage, it raining a little, but not much.

1664-08-05 12:10 W. Joyce and I out of towne toward Highgate. At Kentish-towne, showing me the place and manner of Clun’s being killed and laid in a ditch.

1664-08-05 10:38 And so through the City, not a little proud, God knows, to be seen upon so pretty a beast.

1664-08-05 10:10 I dressed myself, and so mounted upon a very pretty mare, sent me by Sir W. Warren, according to his promise yesterday.

1664-08-05 04:36 Up very betimes and set my plaisterer to work about whiting and colouring my musique roome.

1664-08-04 17:28 Clun, one of their best actors, was, the last night, going out of towne, set upon and murdered. It seems most cruelly butchered and bound.

1664-08-04 17:08 I was much pleased with the play, and it being given me, I look upon it as no breach to my oathe.

1664-08-04 17:06 Sir W. Penn did carry me to a play and pay for me at the King’s house, which is “The Rivall Ladys,” an innocent and most pretty witty play.

1664-08-04 13:37 Dined with Sir W. Pen, a piece of beef only, and I counterfeited a friendship and mirth which I cannot have with him.

1664-08-04 12:05 To the office, fitting myself against a great dispute about the East India Company, which spent afterwards with us all the morning.

1664-08-03 10:10 Mr Coventry and I discoursed of the likeliness of a Dutch warr which I think is likely. The Dutch do prepare a fleet to oppose us at Guinny.

1664-08-03 08:03 To Mr. Blagrave’s, and had his consent for his kinswoman to come to be with my wife for her woman, at which I am well pleased.

1664-08-03 05:58 Up betimes and set some joyners on work to new lay my floor in our wardrobe, which I intend to make a room for musique.

1664-08-02 20:55 To Sir W. Pen, and with him to Church to lay his brother in the ground, wherein nothing handsome at all.

1664-08-02 17:22 Four operas it shall have in the year; we shall have the best scenes and machines, and every thing as magnificent as is in Christendome.

1664-08-02 17:20 Tom Killigrew tells me that he is setting up a Nursery; that is, is going to build a house, wherein he will have common plays acted.

1664-08-02 17:04 To the King’s play-house, and there saw “Bartholomew Fayre,” which do still please me; and is, as it is acted, the best comedy in the world.

1664-08-02 14:42 Sir W. Warren told me that he confesses himself my debtor for my service and friendship to him in his present great contract of masts.

1664-08-01 14:22 Mrs. Harman is a very pretty-humoured wretch, whom I could love with all my heart, being so good and innocent company.

1664-08-01 14:10 Very merry we were, but Will most troublesomely so, and I find he and his wife have a most wretched life one with another.

1664-08-01 13:49 Taking up Harman and his wife, to Anthony Joyce’s, where we had my venison in a pasty well done; but, Lord! to see how much they made of it.

1664-08-01 10:15 All the Coffee-house full of the victory Generall Soushe hath had against the Turke; killing 4,000 men, and taking most extraordinary spoil.

1664-08-01 05:32 Up, my mind very light from my last night’s accounts.

1664-08-01 00:07 I was waked with knocking at Sir W. Pen’s door; and what was it but people’s running up and down to bring him word that his brother is dead.
