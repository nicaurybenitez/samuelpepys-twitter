1664-01-16 22:20 Home to supper and to bed, with my mind un peu troublé pour ce que j’ai fait to-day, but I hope it will be la dernière de toute ma vie.

1664-01-16 19:09 Browne brought me an Instrument made of a Spyral line for all questions in Arithmetique, but it must be use that must make me perfect in it.

1664-01-16 16:20 Though I did make grand promises à la contraire, nonobstant je ne la verrai pas long time.

1664-01-16 15:51 Mais after I had done, elle commençait parler as before and I did perceive that je n’avais fait rien de danger à elle.

1664-01-16 15:45 Je l’ay foutée sous de la chaise deux times, and the last to my great pleasure; mais j’ai grand peur que je l’ay fait faire aussi elle même.

1664-01-16 15:10 I by water to Westminster Hall, and there did see Mrs. Lane, and elle and I to the cabaret at the Cloche in the street du roy.

1664-01-16 12:32 I hear that Collonell Turner is found guilty of felony at the Sessions in Mr. Tryan’s business, which will save his life.

1664-01-15 17:05 My wife tells me that my uncle Wight hath been with her, and played at cards with her, and is inquisitive to know whether she is with child.

1664-01-14 22:15 Home, and after a lecture to my wife in her globes, to prayers and to bed.

1664-01-14 15:25 The simple man knows in his heart that he do not do one part of it. So he taking upon him to do it all we rose.

1664-01-14 15:24 We sat long upon our design of dividing the Controller’s work into the rest of our hands for the better doing of it, but he would not yield.

1664-01-13 20:33 With Mr. Bland to Sir T. Viner’s about pieces of eight for Sir J. Lawson, and so back to my office.

1664-01-13 11:20 Extraordinary good discourse of Dr. Whistler’s upon my question concerning the keeping of masts, he arguing against keeping them dry.

1664-01-13 09:03 To my office a little, and then abroad to many several places about business, among others to the geometrical instrument makers.

1664-01-12 22:10 Home to bed, after being at prayers, which is the first time after my late vowe to say prayers in my family twice in every week.

1664-01-12 21:33 My wife did tell me how my uncle did accost her, and spoke of his hoping she was with child, and told her he should be very glad of it.

1664-01-12 19:47 After dinner to cards, where till evening, then to the office a little, and to cards again with them, and lost half-a-crowne.

1664-01-12 14:36 We had a good dinner, the chief dish a swan roasted, and that excellent meate.

1664-01-12 12:58 Home, and anon comes my uncle Wight and my aunt, with their cozens Mary and Robert, and by chance my uncle Thomas Pepys.

1664-01-11 22:07 To bed. The house foul with the washing and quite out of order against to-morrow’s dinner.

1664-01-11 19:47 I found the house full of the washing and my wife mighty angry about Will’s being here to-day talking with her mayds.

1664-01-11 17:26 Sir J. Robinson magnifying his great undertakings, and how he commanded the city, when the loggerhead knows nothing almost that is sense.

1664-01-11 13:04 At Mr Coventry’s chamber I dined with my Lord Barkeley, Sir G Carteret, Sir E Turner, Sir Ellis Layton, and Mr Seymour, a fine gentleman.

1664-01-11 09:42 The King showed her Sir J. Minnes, as a man the fittest for her quaking religion, saying that his beard was the stiffest thing about him.

1664-01-11 09:41 I stood by the King arguing with a pretty Quaker woman, that delivered to him a desire of hers in writing.

1664-01-11 06:52 What through my vexation for the lazy sluts lying so long and their great wash neither my wife nor I could sleep one winke after 4 o’clock.

1664-01-11 04:03 Waked by my wife to call the mayds to their wash.

1664-01-10 20:52 The things are found in Collonell Turner’s hand, and he and his wife in Newgate for it; of which we are glad, so very a known rogue he was.

1664-01-10 20:50 All our discourse to-night was Mr. Tryan’s late being robbed; and that Collonell Turner, was the man that either did or plotted it.

1664-01-10 19:20 My wife and I to my uncle Wight’s, and eat some of their swan pie, which was good, and I invited them to my house to eat a roasted swan.

1664-01-10 12:35 Mrs. Turner found herself discontented with her late journey, and not well taken by them in the country, they not desiring her coming down.

1664-01-09 16:33 To the New Exchange, where we bought things of Mrs. Dorothy Stacy, a pretty woman, and has the modestest look that ever I saw in my life.

1664-01-09 14:41 I enquired of Howlett’s daughter, for I have a mind to see what mettle the young wench is made of, but Mrs. Lane tells me she is betrothed.

1664-01-09 14:28 But I could not do as I used to do (yet nothing but what was honest) for that Mrs. Lane told me she had those.

1664-01-09 14:24 By appointment I met Mrs. Lane at the Trumpet, Mrs. Hare’s, but the room being damp we went to the Bell tavern, and there I had her company.

1664-01-09 12:23 It will cost me at least ten or twelve pounds; however I shall think again upon before I proceed to that expence.

1664-01-09 12:22 I home to dinner, and by discourse with my wife thought upon inviting my Lord Sandwich to a dinner shortly.

1664-01-08 14:04 W. Symons did make me laugh when he told me how he had to keep in good esteem through eight governments in one year (the year 1659).

1664-01-08 13:22 To hear how W. Symons do look sadly and then talk bawdily and merrily, though his wife was dead but the other day, would make a dogg laugh.

1664-01-08 12:14 One Mr. Tryan, a merchant in Lyme-Streete, was robbed last night, and gagged and robbed of 1050l. in money and about 4000l. in jewells.

1664-01-07 16:05 To Auditor Beale’s, and we did look over old ledgers to see in what manner they were kept and indeed it was in an extraordinary good method.

1664-01-07 13:44 To see how Sir W. Pen imitates me, even in his having his chimney piece in his dining room, and in every thing I perceive wherein he can.

1664-01-07 11:58 Up, putting on my best clothes and to the office, where all the morning we sat busy.

1664-01-06 16:23 Drawing up things about Mr. Wood’s masts, which I expect to have a quarrel about with Sir W. Batten before it be ended, but I care not.

1664-01-06 14:15 Home to dinner with my poor wife, and after dinner read a lecture to her in Geography, which she takes very prettily.

1664-01-06 12:03 To my office, where very busy all the morning, being indeed over loaded with it through my own desire of doing all I can.

1664-01-06 07:52 I began a practice which I find by the ease I do it with that I shall continue, it saving me money and time; to trimme myself with a razer.

1664-01-05 21:31 To my office, that through my room being over confounded in business I could stay there no longer, but went home.

1664-01-05 10:03 To our office, where my head being willing to take in all business whatever, I am afraid I shall over clogg myself with it.

1664-01-04 22:01 Making my solemn vowes for the next year, but I fear I have a little too severely bound myself in some things and in too many.

1664-01-04 16:15 But what will become of my wife’s brother I know not. He is so idle, and out of all capacity, I think, to earn his bread.

1664-01-04 16:13 To White Hall and took up my wife, who is mighty sad to think of her father, who is going into Germany against the Turkes.

1664-01-04 15:02 It pleased me to hear a gallant swear at a man to be so saucy as to strike a ball while his master was playing on the Mall.

1664-01-04 14:47 To St. James’s Parke, and there spent an hour or two, it being a pleasant day, seeing people play at Pell Mell.

1664-01-04 11:20 To the Tennis Court, and saw the King play at Tennis: but to see how his play was extolled without any cause at all, was a loathsome sight.

1664-01-04 09:51 Mr. Pierce told me how the Queene is well again, and the King lay with her on Saturday night last; and that she speaks now pretty English.

1664-01-04 07:59 To the Duke’s closett, where since his lady was ill, a little red bed of velvet is brought for him to lie alone, which is a very pretty one.

1664-01-03 21:45 I could not make an end of writing over my vows as I purposed, but I am agreed in every thing how to order myself for the year to come.

1664-01-03 11:36 I find that though the proper profit of my last year was but 305l, yet I did make it up 444l which in every part of it was unforeseen of me.

1664-01-02 17:43 I took my wife to the King’s house, and saw “The Usurper,” which is no good play, though better than what I saw yesterday.

1664-01-02 14:28 I will not see above one play in a month at any of the publique theatres till the sum of 50s be spent, then none before New Year’s Day next.

1664-01-02 14:20 I took my wife out, for I do find that I am not able to conquer myself as to going to plays till I come to some new vowe concerning it.

1664-01-01 20:28 Ending supper with a mighty laugh, the greatest I have had these many months, at my uncle’s being out in his grace after meat.

1664-01-01 19:37 Back to my uncle Wight’s, and supped with them, but against my stomach out of the offence the sight of my aunt’s hands gives me.

1664-01-01 17:07 "Henry the Eighth" is made up of many patches, that, besides the shows and processions, there is nothing in the world good or well done.

1664-01-01 17:06 We saw the so much cried-up play of “Henry the Eighth;” which, though I went with resolution to like it, is so simple a thing.

1664-01-01 14:29 My wife and I rose from table, pretending business, and went to the Duke’s house, the first play I have been at these six months.

1664-01-01 13:47 There was brought to table a hot pie made of a swan I sent them yesterday, given me by Mr. Howe, but we did not eat any of it.

1664-01-01 13:11 Dr’s. discourse did please me about the disease of the stone, extolling Turpentine, which he told me may be taken in pills with great ease.

1664-01-01 12:42 To my uncle Wight’s, where Dr. –––, among others, dined, and his wife, a seeming proud conceited woman, I know not what to make of her.

1664-01-01 08:57 Mr Deering came with the best New Year’s gift that ever I had, a bill of exchange drawn upon himself for the payment of 50l. to Mr Luellin.

1664-01-01 08:04 Went to bed between 4 and 5 in the morning with my mind in good temper of satisfaction and slept till about 8.
