1663-11-16 20:07 Mr. Hollyard must be forced to cut it open all along, and which my heart I doubt will not serve for me to see done.

1663-11-16 19:52 It seems my wife’s great conflux of humours, that did use to swell there, did in breaking leave a hollow which has since gone in further.

1663-11-16 19:34 Mr. Hollyard came, and he and I about our great work to look upon my wife’s malady, which he did.

1663-11-15 15:20 To my office and drew up a letter to my Lord stating to him what the world talks concerning him. I wait Mr. Moore’s advice about sending it.

1663-11-14 22:24 This night I think is the first that I have lain without ever a man in my house besides myself, since I came to keep any.

1663-11-14 16:45 I hear that my boy Waynman has behaved himself so with Mr. Davis that they have got him put into a Barbadoes ship to be sent away.

1663-11-14 13:24 I bid “God bless him,” and left Will to remove his things, the poor lad weeping, but I think matters will be the better both for him and us.

1663-11-14 13:22 Before my wife I did give Will good counsel, and that his going should not abate my kindnesse for him, if he carried himself well.

1663-11-13 19:48 Home to my wife to take a clyster, and it wrought very well and brought a great deal of wind, which I perceive is all that do trouble me.

1663-11-13 16:03 I to my office, and put on my new shagg purple gowne, with gold buttons and loop lace, I being a little fearful of taking cold.

1663-11-13 14:20 After dinner came my perriwigg-maker, and brings me a second periwigg, made of my own haire, which comes to 21s. 6d.

1663-11-12 14:10 My Lord spends his time either at cards at Court with the ladies, when he is there at all, or else at Chelsy with the slut to his disgrace.

1663-11-12 12:03 To the office, where Sir W. Pen, like a coxcomb, was so ready to cross me in a motion, wherein I was vexed to see his spleene.

1663-11-11 13:32 Dr. Allen tells me that something made of gold, a grain of it put into a silver spoon and fired, will give a blow like a musquett.

1663-11-09 21:32 Mr. Blackburne told me Sir W. Pen was always a conceited man, but that it was his pretence of sanctity that brought him into play.

1663-11-09 11:13 The King is now besotted upon Mrs. Stewart, that he will be with her half an houre together kissing her to the observation of all the world.

1663-11-09 10:54 Mr. Pierce, chyrurgeon, told me how loose the Court is, nobody looking after business, but every man his lust and gain.

1663-11-09 09:10 To the Duke, where, when we came into his closett, he told us that Mr. Pepys was so altered with his new perriwigg that he did not know him.

1663-11-08 22:14 I spent most of the evening upon Fuller’s “Church History” and Barckly’s “Argeny,” and so after supper to prayers and to bed.

1663-11-08 11:06 I found that my coming to church in a perriwigg did not prove so strange to the world as I was afear’d it would.

1663-11-07 16:24 Consulted Dr. Turner about differences we have with the officers of the East India ships about goods brought by them without paying freight.

1663-11-07 14:30 To Westminster Hall, where, seeing Howlett’s daughter, I followed her and dallied with her a little, but I could not overtake her.

1663-11-07 08:42 Captain Taylor brought me a piece of plate, a state dish, he expecting that I should get him allowance for demorage of his ship “William.”

1663-11-06 18:09 But Mrs. Stewart proves a cunning slut, and is advised by the Queene-Mother, and by her mother, and so all the plot is spoiled.

1663-11-06 18:07 My Lord tells me he and Sir H. Bennet, the Duke of Buckingham and Duchesse, was of a committee for the getting of Mrs. Stewart for the King.

1663-11-06 14:24 I to White Hall, where Sir G. Carteret and my Lord met me fortunately, and wondered first to see me in my perruque and I am glad it is over.

1663-11-06 11:02 Sir John Cutler says that in time of thunder barrels of beer as have a piece of iron laid upon them will not be soured, and the others will.

1663-11-06 06:52 My wife was mighty-earnest to persuade me that she should prove with child since last night, which, if it be, let it come, and welcome.

1663-11-04 08:57 To my office, shewing myself to Sir W. Batten, and Sir J. Minnes, and no great matter made of my periwigg, as I was afeard there would be.

1663-11-03 20:20 Sir W. Pen observed mightily, and discoursed upon my cutting off my haire, but I perceive after a day or two it will be no great matter.

1663-11-03 16:14 I caused all my mayds to look upon my periwigg; they conclude it do become me; though Jane was troubled for my parting of my own haire.

1663-11-03 15:42 My periwigg on, I paid Chapman 3l. for it; and away went he with my owne haire to make up another of.

1663-11-03 15:11 Comes Chapman, the periwigg-maker, and upon my liking it, he cut off my haire, which went a little to my heart at present to part with it.

1663-11-03 12:47 To the Coffee-house, and there heard a long and most passionate discourse between two doctors of physique.

1663-11-02 23:16 My wife calling me perfidious and man of no conscience, whatever I pretend to, and I know not what, which troubled me mightily.

1663-11-02 22:58 My wife thought she had taken Jane in a lie, she told me of it triumphantly, but I, not seeing reason to conclude it a lie, was vexed.

1663-11-02 20:55 By coach and carried Mrs. Hunt home, and did give her a box of sugar and a haunch of venison given me by my Lady the other day.

1663-11-02 10:12 I heard the Duke say that he was going to wear a perriwigg; the King also will. I never till this day observed that the King is mighty gray.

1663-11-01 12:52 To church with my wife, and at noon dined at home alone, a good calf’s head boiled and dumplings, an excellent dinner methought it was.
